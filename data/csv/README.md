# CSV IMDb Data Folder
This folder stores the **CSV-converted versions of the IMDb datasets**. 
These are converted from the unzipped `.tsv` files for easier processing in Python and further SQL analysis.
**Note:** This folder is ignored by Git (excluded from tracking) using `.gitignore` to prevent large files from being committed.
