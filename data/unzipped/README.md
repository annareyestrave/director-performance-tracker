# Unzipped IMDb Data Folder
This folder stores the **unzipped versions of the IMDb datasets**. 
These files are extracted from the original `.tsv.gz` compressed files and are used as intermediate data before conversion to CSV format (they require further processing). 
**Note:** This folder is ignored by Git (excluded from tracking) using `.gitignore` to prevent large files from being committed.
